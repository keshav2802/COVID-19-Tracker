# COVID-19 Tracker

An app that shows COVID-19 related information.

# Description

The current situation in the world is not great. But what can we, as developers do to make it better? Well one thing that we can do is that, we can take an API that has a lot of data and then visualize it to spread the awareness. In this application, I have taken an API and visualized the data. The app shows the total number of infected people, total number of recovered people and total number of fatalities around the world. It also has a chart that shows a lot of information about the numbers. The app also shows country wise data. We can choose a particular country and get the data of it. The country wise visualized data is shown in the form of a bar graph. There is a slight animation on the counting numbers as well. The app is fully responsive and works in mobile devices and tablets as well.
## About the API:
I have used the mathdroid API. It is a free API which provides latest updated data about covid. The API returns important data such as total cases, total recovered, total fatalities, country wise data, name of all countries, daily data and last updated time.

# Libraries used:
* React.js
* axios: It is used to make a get request to an API.
* react-chartjs-2: It is used for making charts.
* chart.js: For react-chartjs-2 to work, we also need to install chart.js. react-chartjs-2 is just a wrapper for chart.js.
* react-countup: It is used to make animations while counting numbers.
* MaterialUI: It is a popular React UI library.
